# __Corona VAT Plugin__

The plugin contains the necessary CSS adjustments for the Ceres shop as well as a shop builder widget which you can place in the necessary places (shopping cart and checkout) and thus display the note regarding VAT. Additionally, the plugin provides the VAT note as a container link.

### __Usage__

At least four container links must be set in the container "VatWidgetContainer" after installation and activation of the plugin (successful deployment of the plugin set is required)
- Shopping Cart: After Basket Totals *
- Shopping Cart Preview: After Basket Totals
- Checkout: After Basket Totals *
- Order Confirmation: Add Content After Totals

*These container links only need to be set if the shopping cart and checkout were not built with the Shopbuilder. If the pages were created with the Shopbuilder, the contained widget can be dragged to these places.
